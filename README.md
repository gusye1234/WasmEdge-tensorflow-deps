# SSVM-Tensorflow Dependencies

This repository is the dependencies of the [Second State VM (SSVM) with TensorFlow extension](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-tensorflow).

The Tensorflow official repository doesn't provide a pre-built static linking version library.
To reduce the compilation time, we create this project to build and release the pre-built static linking version TensorFlow library.
This project is under the Apache-2.0 License as the same as the TensorFlow project.
